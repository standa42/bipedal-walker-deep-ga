# bipedal-walker-deep-ga
The project tries to solve *Bipedal-Walker-v3* using deep neural networks trained by genetic algorithm. We used simplified version
of [Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms Are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06567). 
Our best model reached performance of ~290 over 100 episodes.
